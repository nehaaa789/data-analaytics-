## 📊 Project Title: Student Performance Analysis Based on Marks and Attendance

## 📁 Description:
This project focuses on analyzing student performance using a dataset that includes marks in three subjects (Maths, Science, English) and attendance percentages. The goal is to preprocess the data and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive insights about academic performance trends.

## Team Members :
   Admin - Neha Kumari 

   Member - Devendra Kumar 

## 🔧 Steps Performed:

### 🔹 Data Preprocessing
- Detected and handled missing values (e.g., in Maths scores)
- Cleaned and standardized data types
- Checked for outliers and inconsistencies
- Transformed data for visualization

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed distribution of marks and attendance
- Identified correlations between subjects and attendance
- Visualized data using bar plots, histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps

## 📂 Files Included:

- `notebooks/preprocessing_and_eda.ipynb` – Code for data preprocessing and EDA
- `data/students_marks_dataset.csv` – The dataset used
- `presentation/Review1_Presentation.pptx` – Final presentation slides
- `images/` – Visuals and charts used in the analysis or presentation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn

- PowerPoint

## 📎 Project Status:
✅ Completed and submitted for Review 1.

## 📌 How to Run:
1. Open the notebook in VS Code.
2. Run all cells to see the full preprocessing and EDA steps.
3. Review the charts and observations.
